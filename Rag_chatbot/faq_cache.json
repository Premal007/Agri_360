  "How to prevent pests on strawberry?": {
    "answer": "To prevent pests on strawberries, use the following strategies based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**  \n   - Combine biological controls, targeted chemical applications, and regular monitoring to manage pest populations while preserving beneficial insects and maintaining a balanced ecosystem.\n\n2. **Biological Controls:**  \n   - Introduce natural enemies, such as ladybugs for aphids and predatory mites for spider mites.\n   - Use biological control agents to target specific pests.\n\n3. **Environmental and Cultural Practices:**  \n   - Regular field scouting to detect early pest infestations.\n   - Use sticky traps (yellow or blue) for pests like whiteflies and thrips.\n   - Improve air circulation by proper plant spacing to reduce pest habitat and discourage conditions favorable for pests.\n\n4. **Chemical Controls (use only when necessary):**  \n   - Apply insecticidal soaps for aphids.\n   - Use neem-based insecticides for whiteflies.\n   - Apply spinosad-based insecticides for thrips.\n   - Use targeted acaricides for spider mites.\n\n5. **Physical Controls:**  \n   - Regular spraying of water can help dislodge spider mites.\n   - Manual weeding to reduce pest habitat.\n\n6. **Choose Resistant Varieties:**  \n   - Where possible, select strawberry varieties that are bred to be resistant to common pests.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, pest problems can be reduced, protecting both the strawberry crop and the environment.",

  "What are the common diseases affecting Okra and how to manage them?": {
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, a common disease affecting okra is Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus (BYLVMV). \n\nManagement strategies include:\n\n- Use resistant or tolerant varieties such as Aruna (red-fruited), Susthira, Arka Anamika, Arka Abhay for resistance, and Punjab Padmini, Parbhani Kranti for tolerance.\n- Apply good field practices to prevent disease transmission.\n- Place yellow sticky traps (12 per acre) above plant height to monitor and catch vector insects such as whiteflies, which transmit the virus.\n- Destroy weeds and other wild hosts, especially croton (Croton sparsiflora).\n- Remove and burn affected plants from the field.\n- Clean tools and tillage equipment after use.\n- Plan a crop rotation for at least two years.\n\nWhiteflies are also a pest associated with the spread of viral diseases in okra:\n- Set up 10-20 yellow or blue sticky traps per acre above the crop canopy for mass trapping of whiteflies and other pests.\n- Spray Azadirachtin (neem oil-based products) at recommended doses for whitefly control.\n\nNo other diseases are specifically mentioned in the context.",
